- By default, the .git folder is hidden by default
- ctrl + shift + P -> File types -> Ignored files and folders -> remove .git
- The .git folder contains everything about the repository history
  - The config file is important, and if it is deleted then the code will no longer be a repository--it will just be a folder on the local directory.
