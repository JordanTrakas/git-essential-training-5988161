## Git Commit Messages

- Commit messages tell us what actually happened in the commit
- A good commit message:
  - Describes exactly which changes were made
  - Written in the present tense
  - Should be a max of 50 characters
    - Could have an extra description if a blank line is needed
---

### Creating Multi-Line Commit Messages

- Add change to staging area
- run **git commit** (as opposed to git commit -m)
- File will open up and you can put in your message. Close the editor.
  - Commit is complete after closing the editor. Ctrl + W closes tab.
  - Otherwise, type :wq and hit enter to complete the commit message
