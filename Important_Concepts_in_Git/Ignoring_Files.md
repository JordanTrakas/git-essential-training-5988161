## Ignoring Files

- When the .gitignore file is used in a certain folder, certain files can be ignored.
- The .gitignore folder needs to be in the root of the project, out of directories
- See the .gitignore file in this folder
- This keeps unnecessary files out of git history

- The .gitignore file in this project will ignore ignorable_file.md in this directory.
